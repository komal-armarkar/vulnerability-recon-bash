## This Repository contains bash scripts to help get the initial information regarding various attacks.

### Script 1 : Google_dork_search.sh 

Google Dork search can return information that is difficult to locate through simple search queries. A Google dork query, 
sometimes just referred to as a dork, is a search string that uses advanced search operators to find information that is not readily available on a website 
Dorking can be done by opening the search engine and then typing the dork to search. But, this script reduces the time to do so by just one command and can search for more than one dorks, all in much less time than the earlier scenario.

- Usage:

The script takes Google Dork Query from a file "file_search.txt" and opens the query in 2 search engines like "google" and "duckduckgo". The number of search engines can be increased and also one can search various Google Dorks like finding XSS (inurl:index.php?id= ), SQL (inurl:"id=" & intext:"Warning: mysql_fetch_assoc()), ( inurl:buy.php?category= )

One can add and delete various google dorks in the file according to requirement.


### Script 2 : recon_spf_record.sh 

This script checks for spf record of a particular website like gmail.com, github.com, yahoo.com etc etc. This check is necessary to find the vulnerability of "No SPF Record" on a particular site. Missing/insufficient SPF record. When a domain lacks an SPF policy, an attacker is able to send spoofed emails that look like they're originating from the vulnerable domain.

- Usage:

The script would ask for the domain after starting the execution.
The script checks spf record with dig command and also with the help of website "mxtoolbox.com"

### Script 3 : recon_dmarc_record.sh

This script checks for dmarc record of a particular website like gmail.com, github.com, yahoo.com etc etc. This check is necessary to find the vulnerability of "No DMARC Record" on a particular site. If DMARC is missing it causes SPF to fail open. When a spoofed email is sent, the receiver is checking the SPF, which fails, then looking at DMARC for what to do next, if DMARC doesn't exist then the spoofed email is accepted, effectively invalidating SPF and resulting in email spoofing.

- Usage:

The script would ask for the domain after starting the execution.
The script checks dmarc record with dig command and also with the help of website "mxtoolbox.com"

### Script 4 : recon_dkim_record.sh

This script checks for dkim record of a particular website like gmail.com, github.com, yahoo.com etc etc. This check is necessary to find the vulnerability of "No DKIM Record" on a particular site. DKIM is a technique to authorize the domain name which is associated with a message through cryptographic authentication. If DKIM is not present, it may allow phishing mails, increase in spamming.

- Usage:

The script would ask for the domain after starting the execution.
The script checks dkim record with dig command and also with the help of website "mxtoolbox.com"
